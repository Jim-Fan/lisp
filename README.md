Hello, this LISP interpreter is no longer maintained or developed.

I am now working on an interpreter for untyped lambda calculus which
is found [here](https://github.com/Jim-Fan/lambda). Progress is good.

This LISP interpreter is a horrible failure. It demonstrates how
a piece of software can go wrong without proper backup by theory
(of programming language for this case) and practical knowledge
of tools in use (parser generator and lexer for this case).

Nonetheless I would keep repo here, archived, to remind myself :-)
